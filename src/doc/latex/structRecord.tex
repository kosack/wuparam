\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
Records are readable/writable (i.e. 

serializable) representations of data. For example, a \hyperlink{classDataReader}{DataReader} should read data from a file and return a \hyperlink{structRecord}{Record} for each event read; the corresponding \hyperlink{classDataWriter}{DataWriter} would write a \hyperlink{structRecord}{Record} to disk.
